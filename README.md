Raindrop_Game_Final
===================

I need GitHub help:( this is an attempt to publish my final raindrop game

IT'S RAINING CATS AND DOGS!

Press any key to start

The catcher is an umbrella, a thing designed to keep you dry in a rain storm

There is an array of falling raindrops, cats, and dogs

Catch the falling raindrops with the catcher, which will recognize the drops

When a raindrop is caught, points go up by one

Stay away from falling cats and dogs, which the catcher also recognizes

When a cat or dog is caught, points decrease by five

When points reach a value of -5, you lose

When you win or lose,  a "play again" option will show up. click to play again

Notes: 
Click in between "play" and "again" to play again
After you win or lose and the play again screen shows up, you are still able to change your score by catching cats, dogs, or raindrops. I couldn't fix that without causing other problems
Most of the time when you click play again, for some reason cats and dogs fall first from the middle of the screen and their falling points move up until they are falling from the top. Same happens with the raindrops. I had to leave it like that because if i didn't, the game would run out of falling cats and dogs and would freeze. I can't figure out how to fix it.
